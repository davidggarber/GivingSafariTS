            <br />Tablets, such as iPad, work ok.
            <br />Mobile phones struggle to see enough of a puzzle, especially with a virtual keyboard.

            <br />Like a paper puzzle, take notes anywhere on the page.

            <br />The most common code is 1➜A, 2➜B, &hellip; 26➜Z.
            <br />Several puzzles offer a link to a helpful decoder (as in the corner below).

            <br />It will confirm correct answers, and mark those puzzles complete on the home page.
            <br />In some cases, it will confirm intermediate answers. No penalty for guessing.

            <br />A meta puzzle is one whose inputs come from solving other puzzles.
            <br />As you solve the feeders that lead to it, progress will show on the home page.
            <br />Those materials should then auto-populate on the meta puzzle's page.

            <br />PDFs for all puzzles in a round can be found from the home page.
            <br />If printing the current puzzle from your browser, use these settings:
            <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✔️&nbsp;Margins = None
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✔️&nbsp;Background graphics = checked

          <td><b>Log in!</b>
            <br />Logging in allows the organizers to see how many puzzles you've solved.
            <br />Player name is arbitrary, and is not linked to your identity.
            <br />But player name + avatar🐶 should be unique, or the system may merge you.

          <td><b>Join a team!</b>
            <br />Team names are also arbitrary. Try to be unique.
            <br />All members of a team can see each other's progress on puzzles.
            <br />Answers are <u>not</u> shared, so you can each enjoy every puzzle.
            <br />But, if anyone unlocks materials for a meta, those are unlocked for all.

          <td><b>Vote!</b>

            <br />A rating UI is at the top of every puzzle page.
