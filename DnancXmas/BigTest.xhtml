        Beverly Toegold is a halfling paladin who is a proud member of the Green Teen scout troop. 
        Green Teens are never mean, their souls are sublime, and their hearts are pristine. And of 
        course, Green Teens always try to do the right thing.  
        Beverly is taking a test. But sometimes, there might be multiple right answers, or no right 
        answers at all! Beverly likes to eliminate all the wrong answers first, and then neatly fill in the 
        bubbles for all the correct answers. Help Beverly ace the test and find a word that he could use 
        to describe himself.
