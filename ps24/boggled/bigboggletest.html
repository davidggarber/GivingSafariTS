Welcome to the source code for Big Boggle!
     


If you continue, you will spoil the fun of solving the puzzle on your own.


















OK, fine, you're still here. Here's some ways you can help out Puzzle Safari:

* Volunteering - it takes a lot of us to come up with these puzzles, and we can always use more help. 
  If you're interested in helping out, please let us know.


* Donations - it takes a lot of cash to figure out the servers, hosting security for the event,
    and we can always use more help.


* Not sneaking looks into the source code for answers.


OK, public service announcement off. The answer is sitting there, unencrypted, somewhere around line 727.

I think. Just search for 'CORRECT', you'll find it.

Either way, however you choose to play today, have fun and stay hydrated!
